		*Daemon Thread in Java
		Daemon thread in java is a service provider thread that provides services to the user thread. 
		Its life depend on the mercy of user threads i.e. when all the user threads dies, 
		JVM terminates this thread automatically.
		There are many java daemon threads running automatically e.g. gc, finalizer etc.
		
		*Points to remember for Daemon Thread in Java
		It provides services to user threads for background supporting tasks. It has no role in life than to serve user threads.
		Its life depends on user threads.
		It is a low priority thread.
		
		There are two methods for daemon Tread
			public void setDaemon(boolean status) [It is used to mark the current thread as daemon thread or user thread]
			public boolean isDaemon() [It is used to check that current is daemon.]

Note: You can see all the detail by typing the jconsole in the command prompt. 
	  The jconsole tool provides information about the loaded classes, memory usage, running threads etc.
